## Event Page Template

Event pages tend to follow the same template, with a count down, a signup form, and an itinerary. Settings for the event are stored on the event page's component itself.

!!! note "Variables"

    - `startDate` - Start date of the event
    - `eventActive` - Whether the event is in progress or not.
        - If `false`, a timer will be shown that counts down to the kickoff date and time.
        - If  `true`, then the `itchioLink` will be displayed, and the signup form will be renamed to "Late Signup Form".

!!! note "Sections"

    - `Header` section
        - This is usually controlled by variables on the event page's component
    - `Itinerary` section
        - Displays the itinerary for the game jam.
        - Each itinerary entry is displayed as an `app-event-card`, and has a main section and a Google Maps embed.
        - Make sure the Google Maps `iframe` embed has it's `src` attribute filled out to the correct value.
            - This `src` value can be obtained by going to Google Maps
            - Finding the location of the event
            - Clicking on Share -> Embed a map
            - Copy the string from the `src` section of the `iframe` that Google Maps generates for you.
    - `FAQ` section
        - Displays frequently asked questions.
        - Feel free to add or remove questions as needed.
