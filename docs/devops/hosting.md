    -   Once connected you can drag files into your VSCode file system to upload them, right click files to download, and perform all of VSCode's normal features (editing files, using the terminal, etc).

## Overview

After developing software we need to host it on a server. It's recommended to host on a cloud platform, so you don't need to worry about hardware maintenance of the server. Most cloud platforms run on the Linux operating system since it's free and open-source. This article will go over hosting on a Linux platform.

It's recommended to host the server on Linode, since their cheapest option is a `Nanode`, which charges $5 a month.

## Service Management

First you need to get the built files for the backend and discord bot onto your server. If your server is powerful enough, you can clone the repository onto the the server itself and then run a build there. Otherwise, you can build them locally on your machine, and then upload them to the server.

-   [Discord bot repository](https://github.com/RUCOGS/rucogs-discord-bot)
-   [Backend repository](https://github.com/RUCOGS/rucogs.github.io-backend)

Note that both the backend and discord bot repositories have a `.service` file in them. Make sure you have these files on your server as well. By default, these service files assume you cloned the repositories on your root directory, and that you've built a production version of the repos on the server itself. This means it expects the built files to be stored in a `dist` folder underneath each repository. If you decide to place the built files in a different location, don't forget to change the file paths in each of the service files.

Given a `.service` file named `myservice.service`, you can start it by navigating to the directory containing the file and then running

```bash
systemctl start myservice
```

So in order to start the backend and discord bots, you need to bavigate to the directory containing `rucogs.service` and run

```bash
sudo systemctl start rucogs
```

Then navigate to the directory containing `rucogs-discord.service` and run

```bash
sudo systemctl start rucogs-discord
```

To check the status of a service and view it's output, you can do

```bash
systemctl status myservice
```

To restart a service, you can do

```bash
systemctl restart myservice
```

!!! note

    The `rucogs.service` and `rucogs-discord.service` files are configured to restart themselves if they ever crash.

To setup the music bot, follow the instructions on the [JMusicBot wiki](https://jmusicbot.com/setup/). This site includes information on setting up a `.service` file for the bot.

!!! note

    You may need to install the required dependencies on your server to get the services to run. Both `rucogs` and
    `rucogs-discord` services require Node.js and the music bot requires Java.

### Linode Mailing Setup

By default, Linode blocks mail ports to prevent spam. If you are using Linode for your server hosting, please make sure to open a support ticket to request mail port access. You should explain to the support team that you need the mailing port to host a backend for the game development club at Rutgers University, which may send mail to club members for identity verification purposes. They should lift the mail port ban in a few business-days after seeing your request.

## NGINX

NGINX is a web server designed for use cases involving high volumes of traffic, and itâ€™s a popular, lightweight, high-performance solution. We can use NGINX to setup SSL/TLS certificates, as well use it as a proxy server to forward traffic from specific URL locations to our running services.

For example instead of having to connect to our backend service using a port with `mydomain.com:8000`, you can use `mydomain.com/rucogs/backend` to connect to the server.

Please check of the following guides to set up NGINX:

-   [setting up NGINX in an Ubuntu 20.04 Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-use-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04/)
-   [Beginner's Guide to NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)
-   [Sites Enabled with NGINX or Apache](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-enable-disable-website/)

Here's an example NGINX conf file used by Alan to host the backend on his personal website at [atlinx.net](https://atlinx.net). It's stored underneath the `site-enabled` directory of NGINX.

```NGINX
# /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
server {
  root /var/www/html;

  location /rucogs/test/frontend/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8081/rucogs/test/frontend/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }

  location /rucogs/frontend {
    alias /var/www/rucogs/;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
  }

  location /rucogs/backend/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;

  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  server_name atlinx.net www.atlinx.net;

  return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

### Lets Encrypt

An important part of setting up the server is getting SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates let you encrypt traffic to the server, making communication more secure. Sites that have SSL/TLS certificates will show a lock icon in the browser when connecting to them. If you are using NGINX, you can follow [this NGINX guide on setting up Let's Encrypt.](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/).

!!! note

    It's important to pass on hosting of the backend as new Webmasters replace old ones.

    Member who is hosting the backend and discord bot as of **5/27/23**:

    - Alan Tong (Linode Nanode - $5 a month) (Discord: `atlinx`)

!!! note

    It's important to ensure we have access to the cogs.club domain.

    Alumni who currently owns the cogs.club domain:

    - Harry Stern (Discord: `ohmyachingtentacles`)
