## Overview

Continuous integration and deployment is the process of automatically running unit tests and building/deploying software. We only use GitHub Actions at the moment to automate deployment of the website as well as perform weekly backups.

## Website

We use this for our website, since it's hosted on GitHub Pages. Inside our `rucogs.github.io` repository, we have `.github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yml` workflow show below. This workflow automatically builds and deploys the website to GitHub Pages any time there is a commit made to the `main` branch.

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v2 # If you're using actions/checkout@v2 you must set persist-credentials to false in most cases for the deployment to work correctly.
              with:
                  persist-credentials: false
            - name: Use Node.js (Latest)
              uses: actions/setup-node@v2
              with:
                  node-version: "14"
                  check-latest: true
            - name: Build
              run: |
                  npm install -g @angular/cli
                  npm install
                  npm run build
                  cp dist/index.html dist/404.html
            - name: Deploy
              uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.2.5
              with:
                  branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
                  folder: dist # The folder the action should deploy.
```

## Backups

We also use GitHub Actions to automate backups of both the database and users' uploaded files. Inside our `rucogs-infrastructure-backup` repository, we have `.github/workflows/actions.yml` workflow shown below. This workflows requires the URI connection string to the MongoDB database, as well as the

```yaml
name: ðŸ“¦ Make Backups
on:
    # Schedule updates (once every week)
    schedule:
        - cron: "0 0 * * 0"
    push:
        branches: ["main"]

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Non-sensitive configuration can be done in the workflow file itself

-   `MONGODB_TOOLS_DOWNLOAD` - A environment variable that links to a download for `mongodump`, a tool that can dump the contents of the database into a file.
    We use this to create a backup of the MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
-   `BACKEND_UPLOADS_DIR` - A environment variable that holds the absolute path to directory of the uploads folder within the backend server.
-   ` cron: "0 0 * * 0"` - Sets up a the backup action to run every month using a cron expression. You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to build a cron expression.
    At the moment it runs the action at 00:00 on Sundays.

### Secrets

Sensitive information is stored as a repository secret on our GitHub repository. Here is a list of the follow secrets that can be configured

-   `MONGO_URI` - The [MongoDB connection string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) used to connect to our `MainDB` database
-   `BACKEND_URI` - The ssh connection string to the backend. It's typically `root@123.45.678` where `123.45.678` represents your server's IP address.
-   `BACKEND_ROOT_PASS` - The password of the backend for the user you specified in the `BACKEND_URI`.
