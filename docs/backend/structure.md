# Structure

## Folder Structure

-   `src` - Contains
    -   `server.ts` - The entry point of the backend. It reads the command line arguments or environment variables to start a server in development or production mode.
    -   `config` - Stores config files that change how the backend runs. See the [Config section](#config) for more information
    -   `_tools` - Contains code used by Node.JS scripts defined in our `package.json`.
    -   `controllers` - Contains "controllers" which are scripts or folders of scripts that perform certain functionality. This is a more structured version of `utils` and `misc` folders.
    -   `generated` - Auto-generated code based on our GraphQL schema
    -   `graphql` - Contains the GraphQL schema defined in TypeScript
    -   `middlewares` - Middleware for Typetta
    -   `misc` - Contains miscellaneous helper code
    -   `routes` - Contains all the routes in the backend. Note that accessing data is done by Apollo server's GraphQL endpoint, rather than through manually configured routes.
    -   `shared` - Code that's shared between the backend and frontends
    -   `utils` - Utility code.
-   `dist` - Where the release version of the backend is stored once you build it.
-   `gulpfile.js` - Script that automates copying assets over when you build the backend.
-   `rucogs.service` - Service file for hosting backend. See [DevOps/Hosting](../devops/hosting.md) for more information.
-   `tsconfig.json` - Configuration for TypeScript
-   `typetta.yml` - Configuration for Typetta

## NodeJS Scripts

-   `start` - Runs the built backend from the `dist` folder.
-   `start:recompile` - Compiles the backend and then runs it.
-   `start:rebuild` - Regenerates and recompiles the backend, and then runs it.
-   `mock` - Runs a mock server with dummy data from the `dist/_tools` folder
-   `mock:recompile` - Recompiles the backend and runs it with dummy data.
-   `tools` - Runs the server in tool mode
    -   Tool mode is used at the moment to automatically generate a GraphQL TypeScript typings from the running Apollo server. The generated files are placed under the `src/generated` folder.
-   `tools:recompile` - Recompiles the backend and runs it in tool mode
-   `generate` - Generates Typetta and GraphQL typings.
-   `generate:typetta` - Generates Typetta typings.
-   `generate:graphql-endpoint` - Generates typings for our GraphQL endpoint.
-   `compile:app` - Cleans the `dist` directory and recompiles the backend.
-   `compile:tools` - Cleans the `dist` directory and recompile the backend in tool mode, which basically includes the `src/_tools` folder in the final build.
-   `tidy uploads` - Removes unused user-uploaded images and assets from the `uploads` folder.
-   `clean` - Deletes the `dist` directory
-   `build` - Cleans the `dist` directory, regenerates the autogenerated code, and then recompiles the backend.
-   `pretty` - Run the prettier formatter on the TypeScript files within `src`.

!!! note

    To run a NodeJS script you have to run the follow code inside the repository's directory.

    ```bash
    > npm run script_name
    ```
